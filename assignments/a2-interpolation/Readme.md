This is a grid of N by N squares, where the colors of the squares between the four corners are linearly interpolated. We see that yellow is more dominant near the NW square; red is more dominant near the SW square; cyan is more dominant near the NE square; fuchsia is more dominant near the SE square.

# Task 2: Draw Curve

This gif shows the construction of the bezier curve in two different ways: Bernstein's algorithm and de Casteljau's algorithm. When "1" is pressed, the curve shown was created by Bernstein's algorithm and has a white color. When "2" is pressed, the curve shown was created by de Casteljau's algorithm and has a yellow color.
