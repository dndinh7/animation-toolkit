The animation shows the blending of walking and left strafe walking motion. Press the down arrow key to make the middle skeleton move more like the left strafe walking motion. Press the up arrow key to make the middle skeleton move more like the regular walking motion.

# Splicing

This animation shows the upper motion of the Gangnam Style dance while also walking. Press the up arrow key to make the upper skeleton have an upper body motion of a regular walk and press the down arrow key to make the upper skeleton move more like the Gangnam Style dance.

# Zombie Arms

This animation shows a regular walking animation, a walking animation with frozen arms, and a walking animation with offset arms. Press 0 to make the skeleton have a normal walk. Press 1 to make the skeleton have frozen arms. Press 2 to make the skeleton have offset arms.

# Reorient

This animation shows a walking animation, but we are able to control the orientation and displacement of the motion/skeleton. Use WASD keys to displace the skeleton and use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the skeleton.

# All 3 Methods in 1 Controller

This animation shows changes to the controller by adding 3 new motions. Press 1 to show a motion of a "ninja run" where the arms are frozen backwards and the spine is rotated forward. Press 2 to show a motion of a silly walk created by splicing a samba dance motion to the upper body and a walking animation to the lower body (up and down arrow keys have the same functionality as in the splicing animation). Press 3 to show a blended motion of a right strafe and left strafe (up and down arrow keys have the same functionality as in the blending animation). I also created a snowman head for the character and floor that is supposed to represent snow. To also make the displacement of the character clear, I created axes that represent the WASD displacement. Press 'v' to show the axes. The green represents the direction for 'w', the red represents the direction for 's', the blue represents the direction for 'd', and the yellow represents the direction for 'a'.
