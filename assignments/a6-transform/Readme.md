The image shows the boxes in the positions they should be in.

# SLERP: Teapot
![teapot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72237791/139501537-24065712-05f7-4436-9e1b-4251e2fe67a9.gif)

The animation shows the teapot rotating from keypoint to keypoint using SLERP.

# Tentacle

The animation shows the motion of tentacles using sin to compute the angle of rotation around the z axis of each joint. I added offsets including amplitude, period, and phase to create an interesting tentacle motion.

# Into The Night

The animation shows a person walking on a yellow road in the middle of the night. The person is obviously not doing well because they are moving in a wacky motion! (Sorry, I'm not sure why my recording software made the black background blurred when the person's head translates over it).
