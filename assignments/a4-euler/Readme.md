This animation simply shows preset angles for X, Y, Z rotations and cycles through the 6 different rotation orders to see how they differ in rotation.

# Unique: Seeking Shurikens
![unique](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72237791/136110395-6b428220-f0ec-4f88-b346-d9ffcfd0adfb.gif)

This animation shows branches (brown boxes) being thrown up in the air in sinusoidal motion and seeking shurikens pursuing the branches. The shurikens are rotating on the way to the branches and will stop rotating once they have hit their respective branch. As well, once the shurikens have hit their branches, they will fall with the branch and go off screen. The branches are thrown in 0.5 second increments at random x positions and will travel up to a random y distance. Once the branches and shuriken fully go off screen, they are deleted.
