The animation shows the orbits of electrons around the nucleus. The number of electrons depends on the atom, and you can cycle through the atoms by pressing the number keys where 1 corresponds to hydrogen, 2 corresponds to helium, ..., up to 0 which corresponds to neon. The axis of rotation for the elctrons also changes everytime the atom is changed. We are also able to move the nucleus of the atom by holding down the mouse.
